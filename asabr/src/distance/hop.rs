    /// Compares two `RouteStage` instances to determine their ordering based on
    /// the SABR standard tie-break rules, but by prioritizing fewer hop counts before earliest arrival times.
    ///
    /// The comparison follows these rules, in descending order of priority:
    /// 1. `hop_count`: The `RouteStage` with a higher `hop_count` is considered greater.
    /// 2. `at_time`: If `hop_count` is equal, the one with a later `at_time` is greater.
    /// 3. `expiration`: If both `at_time` and `hop_count` are equal, the one with a lower `expiration` is greater.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `first`: The first route stage to compare.
    /// - `second`: The second route stage to compare.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// - `Ordering::Greater` if `first` is considered greater than `second` based on the criteria.
    /// - `Ordering::Less` if `second` is considered greater than `first`.
    /// - `Ordering::Equal` if both stages are equal by all criteria.
