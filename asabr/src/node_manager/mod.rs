/// A trait for managing and scheduling operations on nodes in a network.
///
/// The `NodeManager` trait defines methods for dry-run (simulation) and actual scheduling
/// of passing packets.
///
///
/// # Expected Guarantees
/// It is a logic error to have incoherent medhods, in particular:
///    - if dry_run_retention(...,transmition,next) return true, then dry_run_multi(...,[transmition,next]) should do so as well (with identical other parametters)
///    - if dry_run_multi(...) return true, then commit with the same parametters should suceed
///    - delay should not return a date before reception start time
///
/// Failing to upheld these can result in incorrect behavior of algorithms using this node manager
/// (including panic, memory leak ...), but should not result in memory unsafet
///
///
/// # Simulation:
/// - accept(bundle,time) -> return false if no such can be accepted, as an early return
/// - delay(bundle,time) -> how much delay should we wait for before trying to send the packet
/// - dry_run_retention(bundle,get_time,send_time) -> is this retention accepted
/// - dry_run_multi(bundle,get_time,&[send_time]) -> how many of these can you accept to ressend.
///
/// # Commit
/// - commit(bundle,get_time,&[send_time])
